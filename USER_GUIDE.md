# Study Assistant — User Guide

This guide focuses on day‑to‑day use as a disciplined study coach.

## 1) First run

1. **Choose module** (default is your selected module).
2. **Set exam date** and **availability**.
3. (Optional) **Import Study Hub scores** and **question JSON**.
4. Start your mission.

Re‑open the tour anytime via **Help → First‑Run Tour…**

## 2) Daily flow (recommended)

### A. Coach Pick (left panel)
- The Coach Pick is your “do this now” topic.
- It explains *why* (weak area, due reviews, pace, etc.).
- Click it to focus that topic.

### B. Mission checklist (Coach Briefing)
Complete in order:
1) **Focus 1x Pomodoro**
2) **Quiz target questions**
3) **Clear must‑review**
4) **Cover under-covered capability** (when syllabus outcomes show a gap)

Coach Briefing also shows:
- **Exam Readiness Index** and **retrieval quota**
- **Balance checks** (topic saturation or confidence drift)
- **Focus integrity** (verified vs raw minutes)
- **Coach notes** (e.g., miss‑cooldown or off‑peak hour hints)

### C. Study Room (Now)
- **Focus now (25m)** starts a Pomodoro on the coach topic.
- **Quick quiz** runs a short quiz on the coach topic.
- **Weak drill** focuses your weakest area.
- **Interleave** runs a short quiz on the next chapter in today’s plan.
- **Coach Next** auto‑selects the coach pick and starts the best next action.

### D. Daily plan (optional)
- A list of suggested topics for the day.
- **Auto‑completion**: topics are marked done after a counted Pomodoro or completed quiz session.
- If you prefer, enable **Coach‑only view** to hide the plan list entirely.
- Plan is **stable within a day** unless a major import refreshes it.
- If the list is empty, the app shows a short tip (load a module, set an exam date, or import questions).

### E. AI Tutor (local Ollama)
- Open from **Application → AI Tutor…** or **Tools & Data → AI tutor (Ollama)**.
- Pick a local model, type your prompt, and generate an in-app response.
- Responses stream live, include **Stop**, and keep multi-turn chat context until **New chat**.
- Chat history persists across reopen/restart (last 20 messages), supports **Copy chat**, and **Ctrl+Enter** to send.
- Configure host/default model/timeout in **Preferences → Local AI (Ollama)**.

## 3) Coach‑only view

When coach‑only is enabled:
- The plan list is hidden.
- The topic dropdown is locked to the coach’s pick.
- Any action (Pomodoro/Quiz/Drill) uses the coach topic.

Toggle in **Preferences** or from the **Coach‑only** button in the plan header. The badge is clickable to exit.

## 4) Pomodoro + breaks

- **Start / Pause / Stop** from the left panel.
- Breaks are automatic; the timer shows **“Break ends at HH:MM”**.
- Short vs long breaks are configurable in Preferences.
- Breaks can be skipped up to the configured limit.

### Focus verification
- The app credits Pomodoros based on **verified minutes**, not raw time.
- Verified time uses Hyprland allowlist + idle time.
- After a counted Pomodoro, you may get a **1‑tap session quality prompt** (Good/Okay/Low).

## 5) Quizzes and reviews

- Quizzes use spaced repetition to prioritize weak/overdue questions.
- During a quiz, the app now applies lightweight UI updates per answer and does a full dashboard refresh at quiz end (keeps the dialog responsive on long sessions).
- Incorrect answers create **must‑review** items.
- The **Hardest Concepts** card tracks repeated misses by chapter.
- Use **Drill leeches** (Study Room / Chapter Intelligence) to target repeatedly-missed questions.

## 6) Reflections + notes

- After a Pomodoro or quiz, you may get a short reflection prompt.
- Add confidence notes per chapter via **Edit → Set Confidence Note…**
- Review all notes via **Application → Review Reflections…**

## 7) Analytics cards

- **Outcome Mastery**: covered vs uncovered outcomes and per-capability coverage
- **Time Analytics**: total minutes per action type
- **Top Topics**: focus vs retrieval leaderboards + today’s top topics
- **Daily Summary**: two‑line recap (most time + biggest gap)
- **Confidence Drift**: chart of top gaps between competence and mastery/quiz

## 8) Importing Study Hub PDFs

Use **Import PDF scores** to parse Study Hub reports. This updates competence, quiz stats, and analytics.

Import pipeline:
- native PDF text extraction first
- optional skimage + Tesseract preprocessing for sparse/noisy pages
- PyMuPDF OCR fallback

If OCR ran, the summary dialog reports OCR page counts.

## 9) Module management

- **Module → Switch Module…**
- **Module → Manage Modules…** (shows module locations)
- **Module → Edit Module…** (GUI editor)

### Import syllabus PDF (draft-first)

- Use **Module → Import Syllabus PDF…**
- The app parses:
  - Main capabilities
  - Syllabus chapter structure
  - Detailed learning outcomes and intellectual levels
- Import opens a **review wizard** first:
  - parse confidence and warnings
  - preserve existing question bank toggle
  - explicit confirmation required for low-confidence parses
- The generated module is loaded into Module Editor as a draft.
- No file is written until you click **Save** in Module Editor.
- Existing module questions are preserved by default in the draft.
- Parse report shows confidence and warnings. Review before saving.
- Tools include **View Syllabus Cache Stats** and **Clear Syllabus Cache** for diagnostics/reset.

## 10) Keyboard shortcuts

- **F1** Show shortcuts
- **F5** Start Pomodoro
- **F6** Pause/Resume Pomodoro
- **F7** Stop Pomodoro
- **F8** Quick Quiz
- **F9** Toggle Focus Mode
- **Ctrl+E** Set exam date
- **Ctrl+,** Preferences
- **Ctrl+M** Toggle menu bar
- **Ctrl+Q** Quit

## 11) Troubleshooting

- **No notifications** → enable in Preferences
- **Focus tracking unavailable** → install `hyprctl`
- **Charts missing** → install `matplotlib`
- **PDF import missing** → install `PyMuPDF (fitz)`
- **Enhanced OCR not active** → install `pytesseract`, `Pillow`, `numpy`, `scikit-image`, and ensure `tesseract` is on PATH
- **Semantic map shows fallback** → ensure your app launcher uses an environment with `sentence-transformers`
- **Startup recovered from backup** → use **File → Recover from Snapshot…** if you want to pick a different snapshot manually

## 12) ML training and status

- Open **Application → Train ML Models…** to run trainers manually.
- The dialog shows:
  - current sample count
  - model file presence
  - model file timestamps
- Coach Briefing and Quiz Insights show current ML model status and confidence tier.
- Auto-training runs in the background with guardrails:
  - no overlapping runs
  - skipped during active study flows
  - interval-based cadence with minimum sample deltas
- If model quality gates fail (Brier/ECE/AUC), the trainer does not promote the new model and keeps the current one.

## 13) Smoke self-check (advanced)

Use this when you want a quick stability check including coach-only toggles and coach consistency:

```bash
timeout 40s python studyplan_app.py --dialog-smoke-test
```

Strict mode (recommended before deploy) exits non-zero on failure:

```bash
timeout 40s python studyplan_app.py --dialog-smoke-strict
```

Latest smoke report:

- `~/.config/studyplan/smoke_last.json`

Strict mode checks these KPI thresholds:

- `coach_pick_consistency_rate >= 0.999`
- `coach_only_toggle_integrity_rate == 1.0`
- `coach_next_burst_integrity_rate == 1.0`
